# Why does this course matter?

I built this course because I believe in the power of self-learning and open-source education. Everyone should have an access to learning materials without even spending money. As a Filipino citizen, in line with the AmBisyon Natin 2040, I dedicate the creation of this course to offer life-long learning opportunities for my fellow countrymen. Helping them to equip skills needed in this fast-evolving community is one of my greatest motivation.

# What motivates me to create this course?

Hi! I am Von Divino, a 2nd year Computer Science student of the University of the Philippines - Los Ba√±os. As a computer science student, I truly believe that I should give back to my community on what I learned in my school. Everyone should have an access to open-source learning materials. What motivates to create this course is that I love sharing my knowledge to people especially when it comes to computing and software engineering topics.
